# Fortnite Arg grabber [ARCHIVED]
This grabs the newest fltoken/caldera and also all other args
<br><br>
You can see the args I grabbed [here](https://github.com/zinx-YT/Fortnite-Fltokens-and-offsets/tree/main/Fltokens)
## Steps
### 1.
Make sure you left a backup with these files from the `Win64` folder before you paste the files from this grabber in `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_BE` and `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_EAC` in
### 2.
Now Replace your fortnite files with the arg grabber (not the one you put in the folder whats on step 1.)
### 3.
Then launch fortnite from FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe then it should give the fltoken in the console and files in args.txt

## Note:

The `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_BE` and `FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping_EAC` are in `FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64` if you can't find it
